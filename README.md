For this RPG horror survival game, I worked with a team of four, each of us responsible for a specific department. The game is an original idea and was developed as part of my concentration on video games. It was developed from beginning to end and the milestone was to create a vertical slice of the first level and uploading it into itch.io.

Each person of the team was responsible of a department and my role focused on programming.â€‹ 

##Tasks:
I scripted the entire game, including player movement, enemy AI, gameplay mechanics, UI, objectives menu, camera movement, and audio. As the game was developed in Unity, the language used was entirely C# using Visual Studio.

The project was developed within a month, so several features were implemented with a focus on quick delivery rather than optimization.
